                       (such as Pesticide and CleaningAgent) or as ArticleOfX/PortionOfX (such as Coolant and CryogenicMaterial).
                     Removed the ImprovisedExplosiveDevice class since it is newly defined in the CCO Artifact ontology.
                     Corrected reference to cco:Article to :Article. Changed FoodTruck to subclass from cco:Truck.

This approach is necessary to avoid defining hundreds of sub-classes of cco:Artifact to capture the various types of Food, Animals, Vegetation, etc. that exist. The specific type is indicated in the individual's rdfs:label. For example, to define an individual representing the general concept of 'eggs', its classification would be event:Food and event:SpecificTypeOfArtifact, its label would indicate 'eggs', and its general:generic property would be true.
