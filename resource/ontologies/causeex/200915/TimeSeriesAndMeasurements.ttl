    rdfs:comment """May 15th 2019 revisions:
                    Updated the descriptions/comments of several items and modified ReportedValue to not be an Event/Factor, but only
                      related to an Event/Factor via has_reported_value.
                  May 12th 2019 revisions:
                    owl:members should have been owl:distinctMembers.
                    Changed CollectionOfEvents to CollectionOfEventsOrFactors.
                    Deprecated is_about_artifact in lieu of using its super-property, general:involves_goods_or_property.
                  January 30th 2019 revisions:
                    Updated the description/comment for SeriesTrend.
                  November 16th 2018 revisions:
                    Added the class and property, TrendDecomposition and has_trend_decomposition. Expanded the domain of has_trend to
                      include TrendDecomposition.
                  October 22nd 2018 revisions:
                    Changed the sub-classing of TimeSeries (from owl:Thing) to be event:CollectionOfEventsOrFactors.
                    Removed ReportedProperty, its sub-class hierarchy and the defined_by property (not needed with the new sub-classing
                      of TimeSeries/ReportedValue and the alignment of the ReportedProperty sub-classes into the Event hierarchy).
                    Added the SeriesTrend class, its individual values and the has_trend object property.
                    Removed has_time_series as this is not needed (the properties, general:located_at and is_about_xxx can be used instead).
                    Renamed has_property_type to has_value_type and declared it as a FunctionalProperty. 
                    Removed the reported_event_class_string property since its semantics are addressed in the ICM ontology.
                    Removed the MonetaryAmountPrice individual as it is not used.
                    Corrected comments related to decimal_value (changed to numeric_value) and removed references to is_about_using_artifact.
                  September 24th 2018 revisions:
                    Changed rdfs:Literal to xsd:string, xsd:float to xsd:decimal or xsd:double, and also allowed xsd:decimal with xsd:double.
                  July 29th revisions:
                    Clarified the usage of is_about_artifact, and removed is_about_using_artifact.
                  June 19th 2018 revisions:
                    Added is_about_actor and the ranges of the general:associate_monetary_amount property.
                    Corrected the range for the minimum/maximum_numeric_values (incorrectly still set to xsd:decimal).
                    Added a domain definition for general:has_currency.
                    Added the TextEnum individual and the enum_value property.
                  May 2nd 2018 revisions:
                    Renamed decimal_value and minimum/maximum_decimal_value to numeric_value and minimum/maximum_numeric_value 
                       (all defined as decimals or doubles to allow more flexibility).
                    Added that general:has_currency is a sub-property of has_measurement_unit."""@en ;

The TrendDecompositions for a TimeSeries are defined using the has_trend_decomposition property. The specific trend for the interval (increasing/decreasing/staying constant) is specified using has_trend, while the beginning/ending times of the interval are indicated using the general:earliest/latest_possible_start/end_time properties."@en .
